### Folder details

**1. wordnet** 

Solution for the week 1 section "Directed Graphs" assignment. Activities involved: applying a digraph data structure and using a BFS algorithm to simulate a WordNet, a semantic lexicon for the English language.

**2. seam** 

Solution for the week 2 section "Shortest Paths" assignment. Activities involved: making an image resizing technique called seam-carving, which could be done by finding the shortest path of a topologically sorted digraph to remove pixels.
