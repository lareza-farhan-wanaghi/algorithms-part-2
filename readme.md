### Folder details

**1. wordnet** 

Solution for the week 1 section "Directed Graphs" assignment. Activities involved: applying a digraph data structure and using a BFS algorithm to simulate a WordNet, a semantic lexicon for the English language.

**2. seam** 

Solution for the week 2 section "Shortest Paths" assignment. Activities involved: making an image resizing technique called seam-carving, which can be done by finding the shortest path of a topologically sorted digraph to remove pixels.

**3. baseball** 

Solution for the week 3 section  "Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut" assignment. Activities involved: finding a max flow and min cut of a residual flow network to solve the baseball elimination problem. [Learn more](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/baseball/specification.php)


**4. boggle** 

Solution for the week 4 section "Substring Search" assignment. Activities involved: making a ternary search tries and DFS algorithm to find all possible valid English words on a given random boggle game stat.
